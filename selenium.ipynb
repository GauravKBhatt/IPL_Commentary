      "- Kyle Jamieson: It's gonna have to be good enough for us (the total), don't think the slower balls have been holding up as well as the other night. I was just trying to mix it up a little bit and that last over (of mine) didn't go quite to plan. Got to give credit to Stoinis as well, because told me to change it up when certain plans didn't work.\n",

      "- 21:23 Local Time, 15:53 GMT, 21:23 IST: This is an inbetween total that will just keep everyone on the edge of their seats. It's not a big total given the conditions, but it's definitely not a below-par total as well. In comparison to Qualifier 2, this pitch was slightly better for batting so RCB may feel they left 15-20 runs out there. Generally the new ball in the second innings does extra here and RCB have Hazlewood who can make the batters dance to his tunes, don't discount Bhuvi either. PBKS got Salt fairly early, Virat tried to bat through but Azmat pulled off a brilliant catch off his own bowling to send back the RCB star. Mayank, Rajat chipped in for a bit. Livingstone injected life when needed and Jitesh played a stunning cameo. Vyshak cut short that innings and Arshdeep proved why he is so valued at the end. Wasn't getting wickets in the build up to this game but he stunned RCB with 3 wickets and just 3 runs in the final over to carry the all important momentum into the PBKS dressing room during the break.\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Bhuvneshwar, out Caught by Priyansh Arya!! Arshdeep Singh you beauty. His first three overs went for 37 runs, but he's conceded just 3 runs and taken 3 wickets in his final over. Cometh the hour, cometh the man. This was a full toss though, Bhuvi had no choice but to go for it and mistimed it straight to long-on. Bhuvneshwar c Priyansh Arya b Arshdeep Singh 1(2)\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Bhuvneshwar, THATS OUT!! Caught!!\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Yash Dayal, 1 run, round the wicket now for this full delivery, mistimed push to long-on\n",
      "- Yash Dayal, right handed bat, comes to the crease\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh bowling a mega last over to completely halt RCB's momentum\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Krunal Pandya, out Caught by Shreyas Iyer!! He's gone next ball. This was slot, but it's that inswing that Arshdeep Singh is getting with the old ball. Krunal thought he could belt this down the ground, but the bat turned in his hands and holed out to long-on. Easy catch and pouched safely. Krunal Pandya c Shreyas Iyer b Arshdeep Singh 4(5)\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Krunal Pandya, THATS OUT!! Caught!!\n",
      "- That wicket is a huge blow to RCB's chance of going 200+. Can Krunal still take them there?\n",

      "- Bhuvneshwar Kumar, right handed bat, comes to the crease\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Shepherd, out Lbw!! He might have been off colour in the last few games but come the crunch time he delivers. Stunning, outswinging yorker that Romario could do nothing about. The batter went deep in the crease for a big heave on the on-side, Romario was nowhere close to the ball when he swung and missed. Impact in line with middle and hitting off stump according to DRS and RCB lose the review. Shepherd lbw b Arshdeep Singh 17(9) [4s-1 6s-1]\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Shepherd, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!\n",
      "- Romario given out LBW. Looks plumb and he is walking without waiting because he knows his fate\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, full and angling in, driven to long-on and Romario back on strike. Exactly what the batting side needs\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh [3.0-0-37-0] is back into the attack\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Shepherd, SIX, Romarioooo!! This is a monster hit. He is an absolute beast when he gets it in his arc. Brilliant comeback from RCB after a quiet start to the over. Azmatullah went full for some reason and offered slot, Romario gopt under that ball and sent it into orbit\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Shepherd, FOUR, top edge and it clears short fine leg. That will do for RCB. Short and outside off stump, Romario tries to fetch the pull, was pace off, so he couldn't connect, edge flies and escapes for four\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, mistimed pull shot and they can't get back for the second. Short of a length delivery, Krunal goes hard and doesn't get the timing right. Could they have pushed for two? There was a slight fumble\n",
      "- RCB need to find the boundary. Arshdeep is next\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Shepherd, 1 run, Romario slogs, another toe-ender. RCB need more! He played a tad early. Third short of length delivery into the wicket\n",

      "- Just when RCB scored a 23-run over, Vyshak hits back with a brilliant 5-run over\n",
      "- Pravin Dubey, the sub fielder, dropped Shepherd on 1 off Vyshak. It was a relatively difficult catch, but Dubey got there quickly with an excellent sprint towards the ball, but failed to hold on. As soon as he dropped the ball, the RCB fans erupted in joy and skipper Shreyas Iyer was seen thudding his palms in disgust. Shashank Singh was one of the first players to walk up to Dubey and console him. That said, PBKS have managed to pull things back quite splendidly after leaking 36 off 2 overs (15-17). Vyshak finished his spell with a five-run over that included the vital wicket of Jitesh.\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Shepherd, 1 run, Romario early into the shot, ball seemed to have jumped on him and he taps it uppishly towards mid-on\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, leading edge but safe past cover. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Krunal looks to flick, ball rolls to the right of the fielder\n",
      "- Krunal Pandya, left handed bat, comes to the crease\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Jitesh Sharma, out Bowled!! And he's knocked him over next ball. Vijaykumar Vyshak wants to celebrate with a fist pump but controls himself. Length delivery from Vijaykumar Vyshak, Jitesh swung hard, inside edge onto back thigh and disturbing the off stump. Jitesh was looking dominant again and this is a big dent for RCB. Jitesh Sharma b Vijaykumar Vyshak 24(10) [4s-2 6s-2]\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Jitesh Sharma, THATS OUT!! Bowled!!\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Jitesh Sharma, no run, good review from Jitesh. Inglis didn't go up straightaway but umpire Nitin Menon raised the finger. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Jitesh tried to steer it down to third man but misses\n",
      "- Review for caught behind. Given out, batter reviews. UltraEdge stays flat.\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Shepherd, 1 run, short of length delivery, Romario pulls to deep mid-wicket\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Shepherd, 2 runs, in the airrr, man runs in, puts it down. Praveen Dubey the sub. Short of a length delivery on the stumps, Shepherd slogged and mistimed it high, deep mid-wicket ran in, covered the ground and got there easily. In the end he fingertips it\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak [3.0-0-25-0] is back into the attack\n",
      "- Crowd getting into the act. When Shreyas Iyer reviewed a wide call (given onfield for height), the crowd kept on screaming \"RCB...RCB...RCB\". They were silenced for major part of the first 15 overs, and found their voice back all thanks to the intent and crazy ball-striking from Jitesh. After this 23-run over from Jamieson, the crowd appear unstoppable now.\n",
      "- Jamieson to Shepherd, 1 run, crunches the drive but picks out the man at cover\n",
      "- Romario Shepherd, right handed bat, comes to the crease\n",
      "- Jamieson to Livingstone, out Lbw!! That is so unlucky for Livingstone. Just like how Dewald Brevis missed a full toss at Chinnaswamy, Livingstone swung hard at this knee high freebie and missed. Swung too hard and lost shape, impact on the back thigh in front of leg stump. Strong appeal and the ump though for a while before saying out. Ball-tracker shows ball shaving the outside of leg stump. Game of small margins. Could have almost been not out. Important cameo from Livingstone though. Livingstone lbw b Jamieson 25(15) [6s-2]\n",
      "- Jamieson to Livingstone, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!\n",
      "- Oh no! He's missed a full toss and given out LBW. How on earth did he miss that? Reviewed and Livingstone knows he is in trouble. Ohhh ump's call by a whisker.\n",
      "- Jamieson to Livingstone, wide, tries the wide yorker but it's too wide\n",
      "- Jamieson to Livingstone, SIX, muscled! That's exactly what Livingstone has done. The leg-cutting slower ball into the wicket. I know what's coming, so I will delay the bat swing. Picks the slower ball from the hand and smashes it over mid-wicket. This went deep into the stands\n",
      "- Jamieson to Livingstone, wide, another wide for height, this time not reviewed by PBKS because they don't want to risk another review\n",
      "- Jamieson to Jitesh Sharma, 1 run, follows the batter with a full delivery, Jitesh manages to drive it in the gap at wide mid-off\n",
      "- Jamieson to Jitesh Sharma, SIX, this is high and long as well! This is a stunning innings from Jitesh under pressure. He is toying around with the tactics of PBKS. He has challenged the short ball ploy, now the bowler tries to go length and he runs down the track and muscle it high over long-off. Not exactly off the middle of the bat but still went the distance\n",
      "- Jamieson to Jitesh Sharma, wide, slower ball bumper now but it's too high. PBKS want a review but this looked wide for sure. Batter height 1.84, ball height 2.2m\n",
      "- Jamieson to Jitesh Sharma, SIX, oh my word! Jitesh has played a stunning scoop shot. PBKS have telegraphed the plan to him - everything has been short. But the audacity Jitesh had to not even move inside the line while trying to scoop. He had to really bend the back. Could have gone straight into his head but he's scooped is so fine and so well over the ropes\n",
      "- Kyle Jamieson [3.0-0-25-2] is back into the attack\n",
      "- Four overs to go. RCB need at least 50. Arshdeep, Jamieson, Vyshak and Azmat have an over each left\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Livingstone, 2 runs, full to Livingstone, flicked in the pocket at mid-wicket and they get two. Good over that for RCB - 13 off it\n",
      "- Deep point, long-off, long-on, deep mid and deep square are the men in the deep\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Jitesh Sharma, 1 run, short and slow, Jitesh gets a top edge on the pull\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Jitesh Sharma, FOUR, back away and slash the ball! Classic response to a short ball ploy. Width offered, Jitesh stayed leg-side of the ball and sliced that almost over deep point for a maximum\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Jitesh Sharma, FOUR, edgeddd and fingertipped! Looks like Arshdeep Singh wants to bounce out Jitesh. Was a short delivery at the head, slightly leg-sidish, Jitesh swings and gets a fine edge, Josh Inglis jumped to the left but couldn't collect that. Toughie!\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Livingstone, 1 run, pace off and short, Livingstone early into the pull, top-edgish shot lands wide of short fine leg\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh to Jitesh Sharma, 1 run, oh awkward from Jitesh. He bent to ramp this short ball but in the end had to fetch as the line was outside off stump, managed to guide it uppishly towards third man\n",
      "- Arshdeep Singh [2.0-0-24-0] is back into the attack\n",

      "- Jitesh Sharma, right handed bat, comes to the crease\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Kohli, out Caught&Bowled!! Outstanding catch from Azmatullah. He was obstructed by the non-striker when he was going for the catch. Livingstone was only trying to take a single and it wasn't anything deliberate. Short ball into the pitch and rising tall. Virat looked to pull, got a big top edge. The bowler ran into the non-striker as he was attempting the catch because there was no one at mid-wicket. There was enough air time on the ball and Azmatullah could recover, gather speed, stretch full length and take it with both hands. Made sure the ball didn't pop out when the elbows hit the ground. Big moment this. Virat was looking to bat through like he usually does in big games. Kohli c and b Azmatullah 43(35) [4s-3]\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Kohli, THATS OUT!! Caught&Bowled!!\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Livingstone, 1 run, very full, Livingstone swings hard but mistimes to long-off\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Livingstone, wide, bouncer way too high, called wide\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Kohli, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Virat pulls and sends it to mid-wicket\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Livingstone, 1 run, full and on the stumps, Livingstone looks to slog and misses, came off the pad. Signalled runs though\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Livingstone, wide, full and way outside off stump\n",
      "- Azmatullah to Kohli, 1 run, length ball around off, swatted away to deep mid-wicket\n",
      "- Azmatullah Omarzai [2.0-0-14-0] is back into the attack\n",
      "- Whatever was served during the strategic break, it surely stirred up Livingstone. He came dancing down the wicket at the very first ball against Chahal and launched him over long-off for a maximum. Two balls later Kohli knelt down, and belted the leg spinner through mid-wicket. And as a result of that intent, RCB managed to score 14 off the over - their highest in this innings. RCB need a lot more of such overs if they are to post anywhere close to 200.\n",
      "- Chahal to Kohli, 1 run, 14 off the over, flighted delivery on off, pushed down to long-on for a run\n",
      "- Chahal to Livingstone, 1 run, nicely tossed up on off, pushed down to long-off for a single\n",
      "- Chahal to Kohli, 1 run, pushed through around off, a leading edge on the tuck and the ball rolls wide of cover-point for a single\n",
      "- Chahal to Kohli, FOUR, lovely, they're starting to look aggressive now, flighted delivery on off, Kohli gets down low and then plays the slog-sweep, clears mid-wicket and bounces away to the ropes\n",
      "- Chahal to Livingstone, 1 run, tossed up on middle, driven down to long-on for a single\n",
      "- Chahal to Livingstone, SIX, hammered, Livingstone could be the man to provide momentum for RCB, was the leg-break, but he gave the charge, makes room and then smashes it high over long-off for a maximum\n",
      "- They've taken the strategic break, Kohli has become becalmed, when will he look to change gears? RCB need a couple of good overs, 200 at the moment looks a distant possibilty, but this is a big final and as such anything around 190 could be competitive. Chahal to bowl out\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Livingstone, 1 run, slower ball outside off, drilled down to long-off for a single\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Kohli, 1 run, length ball at the stumps, tucked through mid-wicket for a single\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Kohli, wide, the slower bouncer, but it sails over Kohli's head, called as a wide\n",

      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Livingstone, wide, Vyshak loses his line and sprays one well down leg, called as a wide\n",
      "- Vijaykumar Vyshak to Kohli, 1 run, short of a good length and well wide of off, Kohli tries to drag it onto the on-side and inside halves it to long-on\n",
      "- The big Kyle delivers on the big stage: In his last 6 T20 games, Kyle Jamieson picked just 4 wickets. Not once did he pick a two-fer in those 6 games. And today, he delivered two crucial wickets at crunch time. Removed the dangerous-looking Salt early on and just when Patidar tried to be in the mood to up the ante, he slipped in a slower ball yorker to catch the RCB skipper plumb in front. The most impressive part about these wickets is: On both occasions, he got hit for a boundary, followed it up with a dot ball, and then a wicket.\n",

Change of pace working wonders for Jamieson, another slower ball which dipped onto the right-hander, Patidar shuffled across and was a dead duck once he missed it, crashed into the pads, the impact was in front of middle and leg and it's easily crashing into the stumps.

      "- Kyle Jamieson [2.0-0-15-1] is back into the attack\n",
      "- 18 dot balls in the first 10 overs. Kohli has hit just one boundary in the first 9 overs. Is it the pressure of a big final? Good bowling? A mix of both. However, given PBKS' batting power at the top, RCB would need a proper heavy lifting in the slog overs if they are to post a total in excess of 200.\n",

      "- They've taken the strategic break, it's been a cagey contest so far. Kohli has surely dropped anchor, Salt and Mayank got starts, but couldn't convert it into a big innings. Rajat Patidar is in now and RCB will hope for a captain's knock from him\n",

Surely the intent was there, but looks like PBKS have done their homework and the field placing was spot on. Especially for Kohli who loves playing the cover drives. Just 2 double-digit (runs conceded) overs in the powerplay and must say PBKS have done exceedingly well to keep RCB under control. Chahal, the former RCB player, removed the former PBKS skipper (Mayank) with his second ball of the innings. The dismissal looked like a result of lack of enough boundaries in the powerplay?\n",

      "- A decent start from PBKS? Skipper Shreyas Iyer noted that his team is going to approach this as a final and not like just any other game. And on a big occasion like this, you want your bowler to be on the money first ball. Arshdeep bowled a leg-side wide first ball, and couldn't quite hit his straps. Salt pounced on the shorter lengths and managed two boundaries, with a slice of luck of course. In the second over, Iyer had an opportunity to walk the talk as he took a high-pressure steepler of a catch to dismiss Salt. Jamieson got some extra bounce and by the looks of it so far, this looks like a belter of a batting track. Not too much sideways movement either.\n",

A massive wicket, Salt could've blown them away in the batting PP. Was a length delivery and was there to be smashed, but he got it low of the bat, lots of height and no real distance.
